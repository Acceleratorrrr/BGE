Game Engines 1 Assignment
=========================

## Interm Assignment
Please subit through this Google Docs link the following:

A gitHub link to a fork the BGE repository and the name of a branch that has your code for the assignment. 

In the *code* please make:
- A subclass of Game for your assignnmemt
- Have a look at ```PhysicsGame1``` for an example
- Some code to procedurally place some rigid bodies in the scene. For example use a for loop to make a wall

In the *readme.md* file at the root of your project, you should include:
- Your full name & student number
- A description of what you plan to make
- Some links to png's or whatever with some diagrams of what you plan to make
	- Try isometric, top down and side on diagrams
	- Include the rigid body types & joint types
	- Include the power source
	- You can draw these on paper and take a picture with your phone
	- If you are planning o contribute to BGE, then please describe what your contribution will be and how you plan to do it

This is worth 10% (out of a total of 100%)

## Main Assignment
Use BGE (or your own engine if you like) to make an articulated animat or robot simulation that walks, crawls, flys, rolls or drags itself around under its own power. Control via an input device is also acceptable. Like this dragon controllable using the Kinect:

Feel free to use the rift, Kinect, Leap Motion or WiiMote in your solution.

Here is a [YouTube playlist you can use for inspiration](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1n0B6z4e_E5ybHULPRLErccV8BeHvH5V). 

In your solution you must make use of:
- Rigid bodies
- Joints
- Motors/controllers

You should also make an effort to make your creation look awesome. The marking scheme is below:

| Complexity | OO | Visuals | Jazz |
|------------|----|---------|------|
|30%         |20% |20%      |30%   |

And here is a rubric you can use:
